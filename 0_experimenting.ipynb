       " \"What came to my mind on reading the question is the first chapter of Lois McMaster Bujold's *The Curse of Chalion.* It starts so quietly: just a man on a road. But the very first interaction that man, the main character Cazaril, has with anyone, tells us this isn't our usual hero, and this isn't anywhere we've been before. \\n\\nI'll quote starting from the third paragraph:\\n\\n*The horsemen’s chain shirts were silvered, glinting in the watery morning sunlight, for show, not for use. Their tabards of blue, dyes almost matching one with another, were worked with white in the sigil of the Lady of Spring. Their gray cloaks were thrown back like banners in the breeze of their passing, pinned at their shoulders with silver badges that had all the tarnish polished off today. Soldier-brothers of ceremony, not of war; they would have no desire to get Cazaril’s stubborn bloodstains on* those *clothes.*\\n\\n*To Cazaril’s surprise, their captain held up a hand as they came near. The column crashed raggedly to a halt, the squelch and suck of the hooves trailing off in a way that would have had Cazaril’s father’s old horse-master bellowing grievous and entertaining insults at such a band of boys as this. Well, no matter.*\\n\\n*“You there, old fellow,” the leader called across the saddlebow of his banner-carrier at Cazaril.*\\n\\n*Cazaril, alone on the road, barely kept his head from swiveling around to see who was being so addressed. They took him for some local farm lout, trundling to market or on some errand, and he supposed he looked the part: worn boots mud-weighted, a thick jumble of mismatched charity clothes keeping the chill southeast wind from freezing his bones. He was grateful to all the gods of the year’s turning for every grubby stitch of that fabric, eh. Two weeks of beard itching his chin. Fellow indeed. The captain might with justice have chosen more scornful appellations. But…old?*\\n\\nThis is our introduction to a new world, and a new theology, and Bujold gives it all to us without effort, without exposition, just quietly showing us this place we've never imagined but that immediately feels as real as Middle Earth, or Arthur's patchwork kingdom, or Sherwood Forest in an England that Richard the Lionheart has left adrift in his crusading absence. \\n\\nAnd it gets better from there. It turns out that Cazaril isn't at all who we think he is, or who he thinks he is either. And the journey to find out where we are and who he might be is enthralling. \\n\\nMaybe it's partly because I'm an old myself. But one of the things I love most about Bujold is her ability to write sympathetic main characters who are anything but stereotypical, including vital heroes and heroines who aren't particularly young anymore. \\n\\nAnother is her ability to take us in just a few sentences into new worlds that have the heft and density of reality.\",\n",
