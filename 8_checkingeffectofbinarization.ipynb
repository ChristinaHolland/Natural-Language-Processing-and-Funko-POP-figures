       "' The question of whether we are alone in space has always sparked the imagination of mankind. But what should we do if we really encounter some form of extraterrestrial intelligence? In his book \"You Are There - How First Contact with Aliens Could Change Our Society\" (Complete Media 2020), the sociologist Michael Schetsche and his co-author Andreas Anton outline possible scenarios. With his thought experiments, Schetsche wants to establish exosociology - a discipline that deals with the consequences of a human-alien encounter. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n \\n\\n**Schetch:** Intelligence is relative. We\\'ve been arguing for 60 years whether dolphins are intelligent or not. If we receive a signal of extraterrestrial origin, if we find the remains of an extraterrestrial space probe or if a foreign object enters our solar system, no one would doubt that they are intelligent beings simply because of the necessary technical skills. However, if one day in the distant future, most likely millennia in the futur'"

      "I think anything done poorly ruins books but love triangles, as well numerous other tropes, are popular in YA books because they appeal to YAs. I see it as another element of a main character (as a surrogate for the reader) exporting their personal identity and their place in the world. In more adult oriented books there’s much less triangles and sometimes romance is removed entirely.\n",

      "Interestingly, the Gattaca approach would almost negate the need for a large gene pool.  The movie worked by using extensive embryonic screening to filter out deleterious genes.  Inbreeding is an issue because of the presence of recessive genes that are relatively rare in the population as a whole but common in your own bloodline.  Offspring of close relatives ensures that more of those genes are expressed when they otherwise wouldn't have.  But several generations of intensive screening would have removed most of these from the gene pool entirely already.\n",
      "Yes the outer limits was the best! It used to be on Prime, but they removed it, so disappointed.\n",

      "Yeah you're right, Moby Dick would be better if it removed any of the descriptions setting the tone, scene, mood, building on themes and getting rid of anything about whaling because really that  has nothing to do with advancing the plot.\n",
      "If I'm honest, I'm inclined to agree with you and i'm just grieving for a character I was invested in. I'm glad they addressed the issue head-on though. I'd have been more annoyed if they'd let the season finish as planned and removed him with no explanation or a throwaway \"Alex's funeral was so sad\" in the next season.\n",

      "Actually, he doesn't play an important role later, apart from one scene that could also be given to someone else. If one of the main characters can be easily removed from the story it's him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also recasting a main character after 5 seasons is always bad. Cas really made Alex so lovable (which makes it even more annoying he was such a creep in RL), so no matter how good they recast it would't be the same Alex anymore.\n",
      "I hope it ends with people who have clearly distorted and warped understanding, getting the resource and help they need to see just how far removed from reality they really are.\n",
      "That’s not fair when the actor was removed from production for reasons that had nothing to do with the writing\n",
      "I believe that Alex was digitally removed from the lounge scene; he was apparently sitting in one of the chairs during the sequence, but was taken out later.\n",
      "They had finished filming the season when all the news broke, the entire scene was done lost filming with some creative editing. They literally removed him from scenes. The final death scene was a frozen shot of his character. They had the remaining three main actors come back and film a couple scenes with a barren crew to try to add some closure. Can never stepped foot back on the set. \n",
